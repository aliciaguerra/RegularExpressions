# Regular Expressions
- In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a regular expression is a sequence of chaacters that forms a search pattern, mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching, i.e. "find and replace"-like operations.
- The concept arose in the 1950s, when the American mathematician Stephen Kleene formalized the description of a regular language, and come into common use with the Unix text processing utilities ed, an editor, and grep (global regular expression print), a filter.
- Regular expressions are so useful in computing that the various systems to specify regular expressions have evolved to provide both a basic and extended standard for the grammar and syntax; modern regular expressions heavily augment the standards.
- Regular expression processors are found in several search engines, search and replace dialogs of several word processors and text editors, and in the command lines of text processing utilities, such as sed and AWK.
- Many programming languages provide regular expression capabilities, some built-in, for example, Perl, JavaScript, Ruby, AWK, and Tcl, and others via a standard library, for example, .NET languages, Java, Python, and C++. Most other regular expressions offer regular expressions via a library.

#Patterns
Each character in a regular expression is either understood to be a megacharacter with its special meaning, or a regular character with its literal meaning. Together, they can be used to identify textual material of a given pattern, or process a number of instances of it that can vary from a precise equality to a very general similarity of pattern. The pattern sequence itself is an expression that is a statement in a language designed specifically to represent prescribed targets in the most concise and flexible way to direct the automation
